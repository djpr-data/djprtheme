#' A function that is a wrapper around ggplot2::ggsave().
#' This enables users to save images in certain pre-defined sizes: full slide, half slide,
#' 2/3rds slide, and 1/4 slide. These sizes will be appropriate for inclusion in a DJPR PPT deck.
#' The function should remove title and subtitle by default, as these
#' should be added on the slide itself rather than included in the image.
